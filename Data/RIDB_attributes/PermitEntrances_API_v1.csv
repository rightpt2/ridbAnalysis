In 1934 the Territorial Game Commission prohibited bear hunting within 20 square miles around Pack Creek. One year later, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a trail and a small tree stand overlooking Pack Creek (this stand was replaced with the current tower in 1990).In the mid-1950s a gentleman by the name of Stan Price floated his wannigan float house into the Pack Creek estuary. Over the next several decades his year round presence was a significant factor in conditioning the bears to humans. By the time of his passing in 1989 the bears were comfortable with daily visitors from Juneau.The Alaska Board of Game expanded the hunting closure in 1984 to include Swan Cove, Swan Island and Windfall Harbor -- a total of about 95 square miles.",Admiralty Island National Monument,,false,-134.280556,57.898889,2014-05-02,2018-06-14

31,Entry Point,234652,Half Dome Cables,"Rising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon and a great challenge to many hikers. Despite an 1865 report declaring it was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden by human foot, George Anderson reached the summit in 1875, in the process creating the predecessor to todays cable route.The 14 to 16-mile round-trip hike to Half Dome is not for you if youre out of shape or unprepared. You will be gaining elevation (a total of 4,800 feet) most of your way to the top of Half Dome. Most say the reward is worth the effort. Along the way, youll encounter outstanding views of Vernal and Nevada Falls, Liberty Cap, Half Dome, and--from the subdome and summit--panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra.",Yosemite Wilderness,Yosemite,false,0.000000,0.000000,2014-05-02,2018-06-14

32,Entry Point,233304,Denali Road Entry,"Since the construction of Highway 3 in 1972, access to the interior of the park has mainly limited to bus service.  Beginning in the early 70s, anyone who wanted to could drive the road after the bus system shut down for the season in mid-September. In those early years, only a few intrepid souls braved the poor roads to get here and drive into the park.  As the years went by, the popularity of this opportunity to visit the park in late autumn grew. In the late 80s the open to all comers offer became unmanageable when almost 2000 vehicles per day came into the park. There were traffic jams, people camping illegally, problems with pets and wildlife, food storage and sanitation. In 1990, park management decided to implement a lottery where people could apply for a chance to drive the road over a period of four days after the bus season ended. Applications are accepted from May 1st to May 31st and winners are announced on June 15th.",,,false,-148.897433,63.736581,2014-05-02,2018-06-14

The Yampa is the largest unregulated tributary within the Colorado River system. As such, it has a shorter season marked by fluctuations in water level resulting from snow received over the winter. It is characterized by such famous rapids as Teepee, Big Joe and Warm Springs. At Echo Park, all boaters continue downstream on the Green River through the 17 miles of Whirlpool Canyon, named because of the squirrelly and unpredictable water and numerous class II-III rapids. Emerging from Whirlpool Canyon, boaters meander through the six miles of Island and Rainbow Parks, completing the trip in nine rushing miles through Split Mountain, a canyon punctuated by four named rapids: Moonshine, SOB, Schoolboy, and Inglesby, before reaching the take-out at the Split Mountain boat ramp.",,,false,-108.511944,40.446389,2014-05-02,2018-06-14

A unique characteristic of the Selway River is that over a very short distance the river substantially increases in flow volume with each major tributary, dropping an average of 28 feet per mile, creating a technical whitewater experience to challenge even expert boaters.  Immediately below the confluence with Moose Creek, the increased gradient of 50 feet per mile combined with a major increased volume of flow creates an extremely demanding technical section of the river.  Numerous exposed and barely submerged rocks, and stretches of unbroken whitewater with few quiet recovery pools, require a high level of skill and expertise.",,,false,0.000000,0.000000,2014-05-02,2018-06-14

967,Trailhead,273374,Slickhorn Canyon,"Slickhorn Canyon on Cedar Mesa is a canyon of many shapes and colors twisted and carved in eroded reds, browns and yellows. It is an impressive canyon with sandstone walls varying in height from 300 feet in the north end to 800 feet as the canyon approaches the San Juan River. Hiking in this canyon is rugged. There are no maintained trails in these canyons, so an accurate map is essential. The creek channel is frequently clogged with boulders, and there are many pour offs and steep talus slopes to be negotiated, challenging even the experienced hiker. At least 4 days should be allowed to hike the entire length of the canyon and explore the side canyons.",,,false,0.000000,0.000000,2018-02-15,2018-06-14

971,Trailhead,273374,Fish and Owl Canyon,"Fish and Owl Creeks both cut diagonally across the eastern edge of Cedar Mesa, coming together several miles before they enter Comb Wash. They are both deep canyons, quite narrow, with an abundance of scenic beauty. Erosion from Fish and Owl Creeks have created canyons that differ from the other canyon systems on Cedar Mesa by their depth, the narrowness of the canyons, and their pools of water in the spring to fall months. There are no maintained trails in these canyons, so an accurate map is essential. Stone cairns are often unreliable as they are easily knocked down and moved. The recommended route is a moderately strenuous loop which enters Owl Canyon and exits from Fish Canyon. The main loop is approximately 17 miles long and 3 days is recommended to do this hike.",,,false,0.000000,0.000000,2018-02-15,2018-06-14
