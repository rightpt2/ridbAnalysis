6,"<p>Boat Access - There are a number of sand beaches where a boat could pull right up to shore. Murray Bay, Trout Bay and North Light Creek areas have the largest sand beaches with little to no rock obstructions. There are several areas around the perimeter of the island where kayakers can gain access. Be aware that there are very few locations on the northwest and northeast sides that are not cliff. There is no boat launch or public dock facility on Grand Island. Personal watercraft (SeaDoo/Jet Ski) are not allowed on the shores of Grand Island. The dock at Williams Landing can be used for loading and unloading only. Boats may not park at the dock.</p>",,10000719,Facility
106,"<p>Swimming - The lake bottom is sandy, sandy with small rocks, or solid rock depending on what site you choose. Lake Superior can be cold with average high temperatures reaching only the high 60s (degrees Fahrenheit). Be cautious when swimming because this area has not been checked for possible hazards. Please remember, you swim at your own risk.</p>",,10000719,Facility

8,".  Corn Springs was a major occupation site of prehistoric Native American Indian groups.  The petroglyphs at Corn Springs are one of the finest examples of rock art in the Colorado Desert.  They display a wide variety of elements and cover a long time span, with the earliest petroglyphs dating as far back as 10,000 years.  In addition to being a route for Native American Indians moving east and west, Corn Springs was used by the Chemehuevi Indians who moved into California about 1,100 A.D.  These Native American Indians lived in harmony with the desert eco-system, utilizing many of the native plants.  ",,15179,Campground

This high alpine environment can be unforgiving to the unprepared. Riders should carry water, food, clothing and tools and be prepared for changing weather, riding conditions and accidents. Most trails travel through remote areas where help is not readily available.</p><p>	Popular mountain bike routes include the Tahoe Rim Trail, Corral, Saxon Creek, Tyrolian, Star Lake, Stanford Rock, Monument Trail, Van Sickle, Power Line Trail, Sidewinder, Armstrong Pass, Armstrong Connector, Mount Watson, Griff Creek and Flume Trail.</p><p>	<strong>Motor Assisted Bicycles:</strong>&nbsp; The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit (<acronym title=""Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit"">LTBMU</acronym>) has determined that motor assisted bicycles (electric, gas or diesel) are motorized vehicles.

5,"<p>	There are quite a few MTB trails on the Forest.

16,"<p>	Brown and black bear can be found across a large part of the Forest, along with moose. Look for deer in Prince William Sound and parts of the Copper River Delta.</p><p>	Sheep and goats stick to the mountainous regions, but can be found in all three districts of the Chugach.</p><p>	Seasons and regulations can vary by location.</p>",,2337,Rec Area

There are some true giants in here; a former state record brown trout from Wickiup weighed 24 pounds, 14 ounces. A brown trout caught opening day of 1998 weighed over 26 pounds.

It is a 14-mile trail network connected by dirt roads located on the east side of the Moat Mountains. This trail system became part of the WMNF&rsquo;s trail network in the fall of 2010 and was borne out of a partnership with the White Mountains Chapter of the New England Mountain Bike Association (NEMBA). Maps of this network and other non-Forest trails in the North Conway area are available. These maps can be found at the Saco Ranger District in Conway, NH, as well as at local bike shops and outdoor equipment stores.

This Area is a system of trails that has been developed specifically for mountain biking south and west of the town of Buffalo Creek.&nbsp; Three basic ratings are used to give you a relative measure of difficulty. When designating a ride as easy, moderate or difficult, the amounts of physical exertion as well as the technical riding skills required were considered. Several maps give different ride options so separate ratings are given for the different routes. Use this information as a general guide and use sound judgment. Approach all rides with a self-sufficient attitude, giving xpecial attention to the volatile weather one can expect in Colorado&#39;s high country. Ride within your capabilities.</p><p>	To ensure mountain bikes continue to be welcomed on our National Forests, please observe a few basic rules of trail etiquette:</p><ul",,244990,Facility

14,"<p>The nine-mile loop is a very popular day hike for Forest visitors. Allow yourself four to five hours to hike the full loop. A good way to enjoy both routes is to take the shorter steeper loop on the way down, and the longer easier trail on the way out. March, May, and June are thought to be the best months for hiking this trail. During this time, the temperatures are cooler, wildflowers are in bloom, and the falls has the highest volume of water flow.</p><p>Please remember that trash disrupts the beauty of the area; so if you pack it in- pack it out. Take plenty of water. Hiking by yourself is not advised. Poison oak is very common, so please stay on the trail. Have fun and Enjoy!</p>",,249021,Campground

The setting is within Big Canyon and Santa Lucia Wilderness. You will follow Big Creek and will easily find Lower, Middle Big Falls. It will be a little more challenging to reach Upper Big Fall, an 80 foot water fall; due to the steep climb.</p>",,252760,Facility

14,"<p>	Located near Cerro Alto campground. This creekside trail is a more moderate hike that dips and winds along the East Fork of Morro Creek passing through a riparian woodland. The first half-mile passes by oaks, bay trees, ferns and madrone. Watch out for poison oak. Chaparral vegetation becomes more dominant as hikers ascend to a one-mile marker at an old road junction. After turning south and less than a mile walk, the Loop Trail intersects with the Cerro Alto Trail. At this point hikers can choose to climb the steep mile to the summit of Cerro Alto Peak and enjoy the spectacular views of the coastline. Less avid hikers can proceed along the old road and switchback about 500 feet west to make the one mile descent back to the campground. Be sure to carry drinking water.</p>",,252821,Facility

4,"<p>The Jacinto Reyes Scenic Byway is a 38-mile segment of State Highway 33,  extending from the edge of the Ojai Valley to the junction of Lockwood Valley  Road in Ventura County. The route is known as the Maricopa Highway, and it is  the connector for commerce and tourism between the San Joaquin Valley and  southern California. Although today it is a popular scenic drive, the route  maintains its feeling of solitude and isolation.</p><p>The byway travels through some of the most picturesque and diverse terrain in  southern California. Spectacular vistas greet you along the entire route, and  yet you are also treated to &quot;close encounters&quot; with beautiful cliffs, rock  formations, and lush riparian areas. The unique geology, geomorphology, plant  and animal life of the area capture the interest of the casual recreationists  and the scientist alike.</p><p>Looking to the south from the byway, one can glimpse the Pacific Ocean; to  the east lie the Cuyama Badlands.
