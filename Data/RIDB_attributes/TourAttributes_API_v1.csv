Topics may include how the ancient people who periodically inhabited the site lived, how they used the unique landscape of the Chimney Rock area to view the sky, what special astronomical events they might have seen, and what we will see in the evenings viewing. </p><p>At the viewing area, each telescope will focus on a different feature, and the volunteers will change that focus periodically during the viewing time.  Viewing is scheduled to continue until about one hour after maximum darkness. Guests may depart from the viewing area whenever they choose.</p><p>Remember that at this altitude the nights begin to cool rapidly after sunset, so an appropriate jacket or sweater will enable you to remain comfortable while you enjoy the majesty of the night sky at Chimney Rock. </p><p>This program is perfect for young families and those with limited mobility. </p><p>Visitors traveling with their own telescope are encouraged to bring it to the program and share it with others. </p><p>Tickets are $12.00 (adults) and $5.00 (children 5-12) plus booking fee, and are non-refundable. In the event of cancellation due to inclement weather, rain checks will be available. For details, please call the Visitor Cabin (970-883-5359) 9:00 - 4:00 Mountain Time.</p><br /><b>Reservations strongly recommended. Limited space.

49,Long Description,"Take a walk on the wild side! Join Dr. Sue Stuska, the wildlife biologist who monitors the wild horses, in an amazing horse watching trip on Shackleford Banks. Get an in-depth look at wild horse behaviors and the management practices needed to maintain a wild horse herd.<p>The trip begins at either the Beaufort Visitor Information Center or the Harkers Island Visitor Center.  Participants ride the passenger ferry to Shackleford Banks with the trip leader.  Horses may be found or not anywhere on the island and may be stationary or moving.  The group will walk at a moderate pace to find horses, stand or sit to watch them as long as practical, and then move to find more horses.  Each trip is different depending on where horses are found and what they are doing.  Group discussions will take place while watching horses; individual dialogs can occur during walks to the horses.  <p>Reaching the horses may include climbing dune hills, walking in deep loose sand, ducking through shrubs and winding through prickly needle rush.  Except when cold, wading is likely; the salt water could be above the knees.  Trips from Harkers Island are likely to include slogging through heavy black marsh mud to ankle depth.<p>Bring snacks or lunch items and bring drink containers that can be re-closed; carry these in a daypack or shoulder bag (hard sided coolers are too heavy). There is no scheduled lunch break but there are many opportunities to enjoy your lunch or snack while watching horses or while waiting for the ferry. <b>This tour does not include ferry passage.</b> Please visit the <a href=http://www.islandexpressferryservices.com/ target=_blank>Island Express Ferry</a> website or call (252)728-7433.",230,Tour

49,Long Description,"<p>A coast-to-coast total eclipse of the sun will pass through neighboring Wyoming during the morning of August 21. All accounts of a total eclipse say it is an amazing experience. During an eclipse the moon blocks the sun, leaving just a corona of light, and considerably darkening the sky. Often the wind changes direction, and nocturnal animals emerge.</p><p>In Pagosa Springs you will experience a partial eclipse of the sun. During a partial eclipse, the moon passes in front of the sun, leaving the sun partially exposed. Seen from Pagosa Springs, the sun should be about 80%, but not totally, covered by the moon. Given the proximity to the total eclipse path, the moon should block much of the sun for a brief time. While not as majestic as the total eclipse, it will still be a wonderful sight to see. Some of the effects of a total eclipse should occur here</p><p>Please join us on August 21. The tour will include explanations of the eclipse by an astronomer, insights into eclipses historically and through the eyes of Native Americans, and the marvelous Native American flute playing of Charles Martinez. After checking in at the Visitor Cabin and receiving eclipse glasses for safe viewing of the eclipse, we will drive up to the High Mesa and gather at the Great House where the ancient Americans were carefully watching the sun in 1097 when a solar eclipse occurred. What they thought of the event we can only imagine, but given the importance of the heavens to these people, we can assume that it was considered of utmost importance. Tickets are $12.00 ($5.00 for children 5-12) plus booking fee, and are non-refundable. In the event of cancellation due to inclement weather, rain checks will be available.

49,Long Description,"The full moon program takes place against the backdrop of the Great House Pueblo at the top of Chimney Rock Mesa. The program includes an informative lecture on topics specific to the Chimney Rock site, such as the ancestral Puebloan culture, archaeoastronomy theories, or area geology.  Then, guests watch the full moon rise to the music of Charles Martinez Native American flute. (This moon-rise does not occur between the spires.) Youll be torn between looking west to see the spectacular sunset and focusing on the eastern mountain range to see the first sliver of moon. The program lasts approximately three hours including check-in, driving to the mesa top (2.5 miles up a winding dirt road with 20-mph speed limit - allow 15 minutes each way), and hiking to the Great House Pueblo. The quarter-mile trail to the Great House Pueblo has a 200-foot gain in elevation and exposure to heights and steep drop-offs.  Please keep in mind that the lecture before the moon rises is approximately 30 minutes in length, and the hike back down the high mesa occurs after dark.

49,Long Description,"Experience the sunrise from the Chacoan Great House and learn why these events were important to the Ancient Ones. There will be a tour of the upper and lower Chimney Rock site following the sunrise. This program involves an uphill hike (trail is rocky and steep in places) to the Great House in predawn darkness. This requires very good flashlights and appropriate dress. The gate will open at 5:00 AM and will be locked at 5:30 AM. There is a 3-mile drive to the trailheads and a 30/45-minute walk to the Great House. Sunrise is at 6:56 AM. These are reservations-only programs, not suitable for children under 8. The fee is $16.00 (age 13 and up) and $8.00 (ages 5-12) and is considered a non-refundable donation. A booking fee applies to  each ticket purchased online or through the call center. Making a reservation through the call center or website is the only way to guarantee a spot on this tour. Most programs are at full capacity, but we will accommodate walk-ins if space is available.

49,Long Description,"This combination package begins at the upper parking lot with a one-hour guided tour of the one-third-mile paved Great Kiva Trail loop. The beautiful mountain views on this easy trail will lead you to a 44-foot diameter excavated great kiva, probably a community gathering place for those who lived at the site 1,000 years ago. Also on this trail is an excavated pit house, a typical home of the ancient Puebloans. Volunteers will then light the Pueblo Trail to the Great House Pueblo at the mesa top for the Full Moon program before the twin spires. The program includes an informative lecture on topics specific to the Chimney Rock site, such as the Ancestral Puebloan culture, archaeoastronomy theories, or area geology.  Then, guests watch the full moon rise to the music of Charles Martinez Native American flute. (This moon-rise does not occur between the spires.) Youll be torn between looking west to see the spectacular sunset and focusing on the eastern mountain range to see the first sliver of moon. The complete package lasts approximately four hours including check-in, driving to the mesa top (2.5 miles up a winding dirt road with 20-mph speed limit - allow 15 minutes each way), touring the Great Kiva trail, and hiking to the Great House Pueblo. The quarter-mile trail to the Great House Pueblo has a 200-foot gain in elevation and exposure to heights and steep drop-offs. Please keep in mind that the lecture before the moon rises is approximately 30 minutes in length, and the hike back down the high mesa occurs after dark. Parents are asked to closely supervise their children for the safety of all attendees. This program is recommended for ages 8 and up. Tickets are $20.00 plus booking fee and are non-refundable.

While we wait for our eyesight to adjust to the growing darkness, well hear a short talk to prepare us for viewing the night sky. Topics may include how the ancient people who periodically inhabited the site lived, how they used the unique landscape of the Chimney Rock area to view the sky, what special astronomical events they might have seen, and what we will see in the evenings viewing. </p><p>At the viewing area, each telescope will focus on a different feature, and the volunteers will change that focus periodically during the viewing time.  Viewing is scheduled to continue until about one hour after maximum darkness.
