You must carry the waste bag back down the mountain to the poop disposal box at the trailhead. In addition, all visitors must pack-out all of their trash, food and gear.<br>Traveling in Bear Country! Historically, there has been a high level of bear activity in the Mt. Whitney area. From Memorial Day weekend through October 31, overnight visitors must store all food, food related trash and scented items in bear-proof containers.  At the trailhead, all food and scented items must be removed from vehicles and stored in the bear proof lockers located in parking areas. Dispose of trash in bear proof trash receptacles at the trailhead.<br><b>Safety Is Your Responsibility!</b> Wilderness travel involves an element of risk. Climbing Mt. Whitney is difficult and potentially dangerous. Every year visitors become sick or injured; some die.

43,Important Information,"<b>The Nature of Pack Creek</b><br> From its headwaters 4000 feet above sea level, Pack Creek descends rapidly to the ocean salt water in upper Seymour Canal. Sediments are deposited at its mouth, creating a 400-acre estuary. These mudflats are an important source of food for many animals, including bears, which feed on clams, shellfish and other creatures.<br><br>Of course, the main reason bears are here are the pink and chum salmon returning to spawn in their natal stream. Peak bear viewing usually follows the return of salmon to Pack Creek, usually the first week on July.<br><br>The Pack Creek ecosystem is home to more than just brown bears; Admiralty Island contains the highest concentration of bald eagle nests in the world. Other birds, mammals and marine life thrive in this rich ecosystem of old growth rain forest and coastal marine environments.<br><br><b>The Bears</b><br>For generations the bears of Pack Creek have witnessed many visitors come and go. Most visitors behave in a consistent and predictable manner causing the bears to become accustomed to human presence. Unlike most bears that do not have regular exposure to humans, Pack Creek bears frequently see predictable behavior from humans each summer, allowing them to continue their normal foraging behaviors without being disturbed by our presence. This behavior modification is delicate as bears are extremely sensitive to people in unfamiliar areas, human movement and noise. Following the rules will provide a more enjoyable and safer experience for your group as well as all those after you.<br><br>Admiralty Island is inhabited exclusively by brown bears.<br><br>These coastal brown bears are akin to grizzlies of the interior and easily distinguished by a large hump of muscle over their shoulders, as well as a dish-shaped face.",281,PermitEntrance

43,Important Information,"It is important to take your time on the Half Dome Cables and use good judgment. A slip or fall from the cables may result in serious injury or death. Rescue personnel may be hours away and/or unable to respond due to weather or other incidents occurring simultaneously.<br><br>Tips while using the cables:<ul><li>Take your time and be patient with slower hikers.<li>Allow faster hikers to pass you (when possible).<li>Remain on the inside of the cables.<li>Many people find gloves helpful.</ul>Most hikers take 10 to 12 hours to hike to Half Dome and back; some take longer. If you plan on hiking during the day, its smart to leave around sunrise (or earlier) and have a non-negotiable turn-around time. For instance, if you havent reached the top of Half Dome by 3:30 pm, you will turn around. Check for sunrise and sunset times before you hike. Hikers commonly struggle down the trail after dark because they do not have a flashlight. Regardless of day length, each person should carry a flashlight or headlamp with good batteries. Although the trail is well marked, you should be prepared with a good topographic map and compass and know how to use them.<br><br>Another easy way to make your hike enjoyable is to wear well broken-in boots with good ankle support and traction. Some of the most common injuries Half Dome hikers suffer are blisters and ankle injuries. Proper footwear is the best way to prevent these problems.<br><br>Always keep your food within arms reach or on your back. Never leave food unattended. Do not leave packs at the base of the cables even if they do not contain food as marmots and squirrels will chew through straps for the salt content.<br><br>The summit of Half Dome is a dangerous place during a lightning storm. Check the <a href=http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?site =hnx&textField1=37.7400&textField2=-119.6000&zone=1>weather forecast</a> before your hike and try to reach the summit early in the day to avoid afternoon thunderstorms. If a storm appears nearby, do not continue to the summit and, if in the summit area, descend immediately while still using caution and patience while on the cables and steps.<br><br>The summit is typically 15*F (8*C) to 20*F (11*C) cooler than Yosemite Valley and windy conditions are common. Be prepared for cool temperatures and rain showers.<br><br>A few visitors each summer have problems with altitude sickness. Know how to recognize the early signs of altitude sickness.<br><br>For a short video on Half Dome <a href=http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm#CP_JUMP_365187 target=_blank>Click Here</a><p><b>Amenities:</b><br>Flush toilets are available at the Vernal Fall Footbridge below Vernal Fall. Composting toilets are available near Emerald Pool above Vernal Fall, near the top of Nevada Fall, and in Little Yosemite Valley. The last potable water is at the Vernal Fall restroom below the waterfall. Springs, streams and the Merced River provide water above this point, but should be properly treated before drinking to remove pathogens.</p>",31,PermitEntrance
49,Long Description,"Rising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon and a great challenge to many hikers. Despite an 1865 report declaring it was perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden by human foot, George Anderson reached the summit in 1875, in the process creating the predecessor to todays cable route.<br><br>The 14 to 16-mile round-trip hike to Half Dome is not for you if youre out of shape or unprepared. You will be gaining elevation (a total of 4,800 feet) most of your way to the top of Half Dome. Most say the reward is worth the effort. Along the way, youll encounter outstanding views of Vernal and Nevada Falls, Liberty Cap, Half Dome, and--from the subdome and summit--panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra.<br><br>For further information on Half Dome and Yosemite National Park click http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/halfdome.htm",31,PermitEntrance

Come early to acclimate to the high altitude. 22 miles to the summit and back, combined with the affects of high altitude make this a strenuous trip. Stay together as a group in case your friends need help. Bring adequate supplies of food, water and clothing, the weather can change very quickly.<br><br><b>Dispose of Waste Properly!</b> All Mt. Whitney visitors must pack-out their solid human waste. Pack-out kits are distributed with wilderness permits. You must carry the waste bag back down the mountain to the poop disposal box at the trailhead. In addition, all visitors must pack-out all of their trash, food and gear.<br><br><b>Traveling in Bear Country!</b> Historically, there has been a high level of bear activity in the Mt. Whitney area. From Memorial Day weekend through October 31, overnight visitors must store all food, food related trash and scented items in bear-proof containers.  At the trailhead, all food and scented items must be removed from vehicles and stored in the bear proof lockers located in parking areas. Dispose of trash in bear proof trash receptacles at the trailhead.<br><br><b>Safety Is Your Responsibility!</b> Wilderness travel involves an element of risk. Climbing Mt. Whitney is difficult and potentially dangerous. Every year visitors become sick or injured; some die.
